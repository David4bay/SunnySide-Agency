## Overview

Top page navigation uses a usestate hook to toggle between active and inactive dropdown menu for mobile and desktop, the desktop layout mainly makes use of grid positioning but also uses flex to center content in some sections, the table layout was done with css grid.

## My process

I used the mobile first approach, starting from the navigation at the top to the footer making sure to structure html semantically for screen-readers and other devices.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

React basics as I had to plan out the component layout of each section of the page and then made use of a react usestate hook to manage the state of the dropdown menu.
